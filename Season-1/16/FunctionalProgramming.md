# JavaScript Concepts

1. **Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle:**  
   Avoid writing repetitive code; reuse logic wherever possible.

2. **Use Functions to Prevent Repetition:**  
   Functions help encapsulate logic, reducing redundancy.

3. **Higher-Order Functions:**  
   A function that takes another function as an argument (known as a callback function) is called a **Higher-Order Function**.

4. **First-Class Citizens:**  
   Functions in JavaScript can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. This capability makes them **first-class citizens**.

5. **Array Methods:**  
   When you use `Array.property.functionName`, that function is accessible to any array in your code.
