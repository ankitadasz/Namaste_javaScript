# JavaScript Execution Context

Everything in JavaScript happens inside an **Execution Context**.

## Components of Execution Context

### 1. Memory Component (Variable Environment)
- It stores variables and functions as key-value pairs.
- Example:
  - `a: 10`
  - `fn: {}`

### 2. Code Component (Thread of Execution)
- This is where the code is executed one line at a time.

## Important Note:
JavaScript is a **synchronous**, **single-threaded** language.
